## Development Process

### Problem Statement
The Indian stock market lacks accessible tools for retail investors to understand price movements and trends. Most prediction platforms require expensive subscriptions or complex setup procedures.

### Solution Approach
I designed and developed a comprehensive web-based solution that:
1. **Democratizes Access**: Free, browser-based tool requiring no installation
2. **Provides Multiple Models**: Allows users to compare different ML approaches
3. **Focuses on Indian Market**: Specifically tailored for NSE stocks and indices
4. **Delivers Instant Results**: Real-time predictions with detailed analysis

### Architecture Decisions
- **Client-Side Processing**: Eliminated server dependencies for maximum accessibility
- **Modular Design**: Separated ML logic, UI components, and data visualization
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensured functionality across different browser capabilities
- **Responsive Framework**: Mobile-first approach for optimal user experience
